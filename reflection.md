What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

While starting this assignment, it was difficult to understand where to start. The thing that helped me get started was looking over the OneCard example and reading the rubric/readme. A piece of advice I would give, would be to start early, especially if the material is still squishy.
